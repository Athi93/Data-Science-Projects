In this notebook, we are aiming to understand the trend of current Google Playstore market.
We are trying to create an analysis and visualization to interpret our findings on the Google Play Apps Dataset, available on Kaggle. 
This is my first ever project on github. So, pardon the errors and shortcomings that may come up in this notebook.

We are on a venture to find out how many times an app will be downloaded based on the Google Play Apps Data set.This Dataset gives information about the Ratings,
Reviews, Size, Genre etc of an app. We are here to find out which of this variable have an undenibale effect and influence of the app being published on the Google Play store.
